To mitigate the directory traversal vulnerabilities identified in the original script, two main strategies were implemented:
Preventing Access Above the 'wk7' Directory:
   Utilized the `basename()` function to extract the basename from the user input (`$_GET['q']`). This ensures that any attempt to navigate upwards in the directory structure (e.g., using `../`) is negated, as `basename()` strips out such navigation, leaving only the final component of the path.
Ensuring Directory Existence Before Accessing:
   Applied `file_exists()` and `is_dir()` functions to check if the sanitized path corresponds to an actual, existing directory within the allowed area (`/var/www/html/wk7/`). This prevents the script from attempting to access or list contents of non-existent directories, addressing the concern of accessing arbitrary or sensitive directories.

Bonus Security Measure:
Blocking Direct File Access:
   Implemented a check to reject requests containing a dot (`.`), typically indicative of a file name. This precaution helps prevent direct file access, focusing the script's functionality strictly on directory listing and not file manipulation or access.

These changes collectively enhance the script's security by ensuring user input is rigorously validated, thereby mitigating the risks associated with directory traversal and unauthorized file or directory access.
