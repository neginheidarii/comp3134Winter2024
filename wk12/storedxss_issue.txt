The storexss.txt file contains a URL redirect statement (document.location.href="/directory_traversal_part1.php") that could potentially be exploited for a directory traversal attack.

If the contents of storexss.txt are displayed on a webpage without appropriate sanitization in the storexss.php script, it could result in the execution of this script within the webpage. Consequently, this could enable an attacker to redirect users to a different webpage (/directory_traversal_part1.php in this instance), potentially granting them access to sensitive files or facilitating other malicious activities on the server.
